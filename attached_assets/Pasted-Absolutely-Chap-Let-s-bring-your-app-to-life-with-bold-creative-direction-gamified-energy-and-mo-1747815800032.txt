Gamification Mechanics

1. Streak Tracker
	•	Fire emoji trail and growing progress bar
	•	“7 days of on-time performance! Keep it rolling!”
	•	Lost streak animation: glass shattering, sad horn sound

2. Scorecard Celebration
	•	Confetti burst when hitting 100% on-time for the week
	•	Slot machine-style spinner when a driver logs a delivery
	•	Reel icons: Clock (on-time), Map Pin (early), Stopwatch (late)

3. Driver Milestones
	•	Badge system:
	•	“Time Titan” = 20 on-time loads in a row
	•	“Never Late Nate” = 100% for the month
	•	Trophy case or leaderboard sidebar
	•	Push motivational messages:
“Sydney Chapman is crushing the week — 9 loads, all on time!”

4. Dispatcher Dopamine UI
	•	Animated “Level Up” when hitting weekly KPIs
	•	XP Bar for dispatchers based on load count
	•	Sound feedback: coin chime for on-time, buzzer for missed

⸻

UI Component Moodboard
	•	Cards: Neumorphic with shadows, showing load summaries
	•	Table View: Clickable rows with expandable detail panes
	•	Charts: Animated bar charts with bouncing entry
	•	Notifications: Slide-in toast popups:
“Devin just landed early — 30 mins ahead!”

⸻

Tagline Variations
	•	“Where dispatch meets dopamine.”
	•	“Every mile matters. Every click rewards.”
	•	“Track loads. Celebrate wins. Own the leaderboard.”

⸻

This UI Should Feel Like:
	•	You’re in a stock trading app, but for freight.
	•	Every action gets immediate, visual feedback.
	•	Colors, movement, and sounds turn data into energy.
	•	It’s fun to dispatch.
